            <h1>My Web Dev Experience</h1><br>

            <p >
   My name is Shaman. I am a 1st year Computer Science Student at College of Engineering Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala. I was a Biology Student in twelth and I was unsure about Computer Science Background.
   I learnt about '30 Days of Web Development' from my friend.
    At first, I thought this program wasn't for me but since I was curious I signed up for it.
  </p>

   <p > In the program, we learnt the programming languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
     We also learned about a framework called Bootstrap and a version control called Git.
    At the end, I learned to host my portfolio website using Firebase.  </p>

          <p >
  I never thought that I would learn so many things in just a short period of time.
  I am glad that I decided to join this program.
  The mentors guidance and the resources they provided really healped me to understand the concepts.
  Now that I know how to go about with learning web development, I will continue to brush up my 
  basics and make more meaningful projects.
